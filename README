version: PCQ
Changes: 
1. The time slots changed to be 3 slots. (TX, SLEEP, RX)
2. REQ: eliminate the seqno in the data packets. 
		REQ carries a startByte and the following 6 bytes as vectors.
			Send: format.
			Receive: To avoid that REQ marks the unreceived packet as a packet to send, before the OR operation, the unreceived bits in the received REQ should be clear.
